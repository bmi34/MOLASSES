## Installation Instructions

This project requires GDAL and GCC to be installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up your environment on Windows.

### Prerequisites

- **Windows Operating System**: These instructions are tailored for Windows users.
- **Administrator Access**: Some installations may require administrative privileges.

### Step 1: Install GDAL

1. **Download the GDAL Installer**:
   - Visit the [GIS Internals GDAL website](https://www.gisinternals.com/release.php).
   - Download the latest GDAL binary package for Windows (look for the `gdal-*-msvc*.exe` installer).

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to start the installation.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation, making sure to note the installation directory (typically `C:\Program Files\GDAL`).

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Right-click on **This PC** or **My Computer**, and select **Properties**.
   - Click on **Advanced system settings**.
   - Click on **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System variables**, find and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit**.
   - Add the GDAL installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\GDAL`) to the list.
   - Click **OK** to close all dialog boxes.

4. **Verify GDAL Installation**:
   - Open a Command Prompt (CMD).
   - Type the following command:
     ```bash
     gdalinfo --version
     ```
   - You should see the GDAL version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 2: Install GCC

1. **Download MinGW-w64**:
   - Visit the [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download) website.
   - You can download the installer from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/).

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Choose the architecture you need (e.g., `x86_64` for 64-bit systems).
   - Select the version (usually the latest) and choose the default threading model (`posix`) and exception model (`seh`).
   - Choose an installation directory (e.g., `C:\mingw-w64`).

3. **Set Environment Variables for GCC**:
   - As with GDAL, you'll need to add the path to the GCC `bin` directory to your `Path` variable.
   - This is typically `C:\mingw-w64\bin`, but may vary based on your installation.

4. **Verify GCC Installation**:
   - Open a Command Prompt (CMD).
   - Type the following command:
     ```bash
     gcc --version
     ```
   - You should see the GCC version information if the installation was successful.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that the versions of GDAL and GCC are compatible with your project requirements.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the official documentation for GDAL and MinGW-w64.
