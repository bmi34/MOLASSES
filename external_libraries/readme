MOLASSES uses the memory management software GC. 

The development version of the GC source code now resides on github, along with the downloadable packages. The GC tree itself is at https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/. The libatomic_ops tree required by the GC is at https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/.

To build a working version of the collector, you will need to do something like the following, where D is the absolute path to an installation directory:

cd D
git clone git://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops.git
git clone git://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc.git
ln -s  D/libatomic_ops D/bdwgc/libatomic_ops
cd bdwgc
autoreconf -vif
automake --add-missing
./configure
make

This will require that you have C and C++ toolchains, git, automake, autoconf, and libtool already installed. The resulting libraries and header files are then stored in MOLASSES/lib and MOLLASSES/include respectively.
